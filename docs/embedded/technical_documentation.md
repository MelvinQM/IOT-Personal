# Technical documentation

Your Wiring Diagram, Bill of Materials, ... everything about how you built your embedded device should be documented here.

## Basic Concept
This project will be a Embedded system take on the game Duck Hunt. This project has as requirement 3 outputs and 3 inputs. 

### Outputs
- Display that will be either a monitor or a small LED display.
- A Rumble pack in the controller for extra satisfying game feedback.
- Buzzer/Speaker that will be used to generate various sound effects and music.
