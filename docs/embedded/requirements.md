# Requirements

To build your embedded device you need to have a clear idea of the requirements. On this page you can describe the requirements of your embedded device. This includes the requirements from DLO, but also your own requirements.

Add some images! ðŸ˜‰

## Basic Concept
This project will be a Embedded system take on the game Duck Hunt. This project has as requirement 3 outputs and 3 inputs. 

### Outputs
- Display that will be either a monitor or a small LED display.
- IR Bar which is to the WII sensor bar using 2 or more IR Light sources to calculate the relevant angle of the controller to the screen.
- Buzzer/Speaker that will be used to generate various sound effects and music.

### Inputs
- IR Sensor (This will be placed on the controller to be used as a wii like cursor that will show on screen).
- Fire button (This will be a button on the controller which will trigger the fire function of the game).
- On/Off Switch (This will allow the system to be turned on and off).

### Extra components
Besides the required inputs and outputs some extra components will be added if enough time presents itself
- A Rumble pack in the controller for extra satisfying game feedback.
- A battery to allow the system to be completely wireless.
