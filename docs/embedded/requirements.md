## 1. Embedded Requirements
One of the given assignments for the minor IoT was to create an Embedde device. This device has to fulfill these 5 embedded requirements (EMBRQ):

- **EMBRQ#01**: The embedded device acts as a client and sends measured sensor data to the application backend over http or https.

- **EMBRQ#02** The embedded device also acts as a server and receives status messages from the application backend over http or https.

- **EMBRQ#03** The embedded device contains at least two types of input sensors (e.g. LDR, buttons, joystick, capacitive touch).

- **EMBRQ#04** The embedded device contains at least two types of visual and/or sensory outputs (e.g. LED, LED Matrix, 7-segement display, motor, servo, actuator, LCD-screen, buzzer, etc).

- **EMBRQ#05** The embedded device uses the WifiManager for configuration of SSID and password (PWD) for connecting to the network.
