# Concept & Design

## Concept
The concept for my project is to make a game similair to Duck Hunt. Where the player will be provided a controller and a display. Instead of using the traditional way I will be trying to put my own spin on it. The traditional way is by using an optical sensor in the gun/controller that when pressed will see if it is pointing at a portion of the screen that's white. Also the moment the controller is pressed the whole screen goes black except for the target/duck. The moment the screen flickers and the sensor sees a white spot on the screen it has hit a duck.

I wanted to put my own spin on it. The controller will have a gyroscope in it allowing it to serve as a motion controller. Similair to the Wii but not exactly as the wii uses a different technique. I wish to emulate the easy of use of the Wii controller but using a different technique.

Additionally the controller will be wireless and communicate with the display through a bluetooth connection. This will allow the controller to tell the display where to move the cursor.

### Demographic
The demographic of people using this system would be an all ages demographic from retro game enjoyers of old to young kids. The system must be easy to use and most importantly fun. This will influence some design decisions such as the controller. The gun can't look too violent and shouldn't look like a traditional gun. Also the handle can't be too large to allow all types of people to be able to comfortably hold the controller.
