# Concept & Design

## Concept
The concept for my project is to make a game similair to Duck Hunt. Where the player will be provided a controller and a display. Instead of using the traditional way of making Duck Hunt which is by using an optical sensor then making the screen flicker when the trigger is pressed. The moment the screen flickers and the sensor sees a white spot on the screen it has hit a duck.

I wanted to put my own spin on it. The controller will have a gyroscope in it allowing it to serve as a motion controller. Similair to the Wii but not exactly as the wii uses a different technique.
