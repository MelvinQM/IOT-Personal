# Create & Test

## 1. User testing


## 2. Manufacturing

### 2.1 Print details (Slicer & Printer)

### 2.2 Prints

This print was mostly to get a feeling of the size of the controller to see if everything would fit the way I expected from inspecting it in the CAD.

Some adjustments that were quite obvious right away was the thickness of the model. 1mm was quite thin and fragile. Increasing the shell of the model to 2mm makes it a lot more robust. This does take some space away from the components inside the model.


To test this design the trigger was printed with a seperate holder:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/../assets/images/trigger-testprint.jpg" alt="trigger-testprint">
</div>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/../assets/images/currentprint-1.jpg" alt="currentprint-1">

  <img src="/../assets/images/currentprint-2.jpg" alt="currentprint-2">

  <img src="/../assets/images/currentprint-3.jpg" alt="currentprint-3">
</div>
