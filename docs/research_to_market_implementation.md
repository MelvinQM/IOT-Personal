# Implementations & Results

From researching various methods for communicating between an ESP32 Controller and a ESP32 Display various implementations were achieved. Some of these implementations can be found in the [research](research_to_market#4-implementations-and-results) itself.

The main implementation drawn from the research is that using ESP-NOW works quite well for this project. You can also find more about this implementation in the [Code](/embedded/code#222-esp-now) documentation.
