# System Architecture

## Introduction
A system architecture is essential for building effective, scalable, and maintainable systems. It serves as a blueprint that explains the structure of the components, and interactions within a system stimulating a smooth development. A clear architecture concept enables teams to manage complexity and reduces the risk of critical flaws. By establishing a clear architecture early on in the development process, future problems can be caught early and any adjustments to the infrastructure will be easier to maintain.
